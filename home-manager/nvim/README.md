Vimjoyer, uses home-manager (in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZAnJ0rwREA) to install the plugins for neovim. I can see the benefit of also having those plugins under the same strict reproducibility as the rest of your nix, but for now I'm just going to keep using the fantastic `lazy.nvim` package manager as done by this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/108fwwh/tradeoffs_of_using_home_manager_for_neovim_plugins/. There is a good case to be made to at least using home-manager for the `treesitter` grammars, but I'll also do that later https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#managing-plugins-with-vim-packages.
